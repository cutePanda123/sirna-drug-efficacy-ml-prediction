# siRNA Drug Efficacy Prediction

This repository contains the code, datasets, and resources necessary to train a machine learning model for predicting the efficacy of siRNA-based drugs. The project focuses on developing and optimizing models, covering aspects such as data preparation, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and more.

## Dependencies
- **Operating System**: macOS 14.6.1
- **Python**: 3.11.7
- **Packages**:
  - torch: 2.0.0
  - pandas: 2.1.3

## How to Train
- Run train.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.

## How to Run
- Build image: docker build -t sirna-ml-prediction-image
- Run image: docker run sirna-ml-prediction-image:latest

## Scoring
- The model trained with the current solution achieved a score of 0.6017. Although our best score was 0.6072, weâ€™ve exhausted all ways and haven't been able to reproduce that result. Therefore, we've decided to submit this solution with the second-best score.
